# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors with JavaScript // added basic display and DOM functions - used mostly textContent  instead of adding/deleting doms for code readability. 

Run this code on your local browser, I fixed all possible bugs that I could find - there shouldn't be any. Focus was mostly on playability, not on display (evident as soon as you run these files)
