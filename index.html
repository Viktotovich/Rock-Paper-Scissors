        // We then evaluate the computer response against the user response, and declare a winner of the round
        // RETURN results for later use, and use the previous function inside a new one to loop the game
        // The looped game must keep track of victories, and stop whenever 1 of the 2 players wins 5 times in a single game
        // DISPLAY winner and loser at the end of the game
        // TRACKS the score 


     // The computer randomly generates a number from 0 to 99
    let computerCalculation = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);

    // That number is then divided by 33; 0 to 33 is scissors, <33 to 66 is paper, and <66 to 99 is rock
